Our MVP will include:
- One game you can redirect to off of our home page.
- This game will entail a truth and a lie question that the user will be tasked with figuring out of it is a truth or a lie.
- If the user gets enough questions right, they will get a "point" of some kind, as well as persisted data for their own high score in the game.

Stretch goals:
- Another "Guess that Pokemon game" where the user is presented with an image of a pokemon and asked what that pokemon's name is out of a selection of 4 or 5 choices.
- If the user gets this right, they will earn a "token."
- Tokens will be added to the website that can be redeemed on the main page for a joke from an API.
