# Cooperation Plan


## Every person on your team is an asset. This is your chance to discover the hidden strengths and areas for growth for each team member.


### Describe at least:

#### What are the key strengths of each person on the team?

- Peyton’s Response: 
- Debugging and front-end development

- Chaz’s Response:
- Keeping top level architectural views and reading technical documentation

- Keian’s Response:
- Creating algorithms, availability to team all day


- Q’s Response: 
- Creating connections between the front end and back 


# Organization for team 


#### How can you best utilize these strengths in the execution of your project?

- Peytons’s Response:
- If someone has an issue with their code, Peyton is always available to provide a fresh set of eyes and some debugging skills

- Chaz’s Response:
- Going through API docs and being very careful to how with intake data from them

- Keian’s Response:
- I can host the GitHub repo, and since I have a high availability, I will be there to answer questions whenever they arise. 

- Q’s Response
- I can be the head of organization and make sure the team is moving in the right direction


#### In which professional competencies do you each want to develop greater strength?

- Peyton’s Response: 
- Confidence, particularly as it relates to reducing qualifying language when talking about code! I will work on being direct and clear in my communication. Also writing. I am going to focus on writing good comments.

- Chaz’s Response:
- Front end styling and linking

- Keian’s Response:
- Back end: algorithms and datastructures.

- Q’s Response: 
- Building back ends more elegantly and making code less dry


#### Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?


- We plan to have a rotating pair coding system. People will have certain features tied to them but need to explain them to their partner to ensure that everyone in the group has an overview of the project.

# Conflict Plan

### Your team should agree on a process for handling disagreements, should they arise. It is better to have a plan in place ahead of time so you can all refer back to it when necessary.

- Describe at least:

#### What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?

- Direct confrontation from one party to the other, but involve the other team mates if it escalates, and if it continues escalating, bring the issue to a higher authority.


#### What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?

- Direct confrontation with the person “taking over”

#### How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?


- Ask questions if needed, and have the availability to help others if they need / ask.

#### How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?

- Direct confrontation

#### How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?
- Get assistance from a “higher authority”


# Communication Plan

- Before beginning to tackle the project, determine how your group will communicate with each other. This is not an individual effort. Make sure everyone feels comfortable with the identified methods of speaking up.

- Describe at least:


#### What hours will you be available to communicate?
- 9am-5pm, and will discuss if extra time is necessary


#### What platforms will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?
- Slack
- Remo
- Trello

#### How often will you take breaks?
- At our own discretion. A good rule of thumb is 10 min breaks each hour, and partners in pair programming can remind each other to take breaks. 

#### What is your plan if you start to fall behind?
- To reassess the MVP and ensure that we look through the scope of our problem.

#### How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?
- Will send messages in Slack and discuss times to meet if required


#### What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard?
- We plan on having daily meetings where we will touch base with all the members of the group. This will be the time for everyone to make their voice heard.


#### How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?
- We will all commit to encouraging team members to speak up and share their ideas. We will acknowledge people’s contributions to the whole product both in daily meetings and during the project presentation. 

# Work Plan

### Explain your work plan to track whether everyone is contributing equally to all parts of the project, and that each person is working on “meaty” problems. This should prevent “lone wolf” efforts and “siloed” efforts.


#### How will you identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general?

- We will have daily meetings during which trello cards will be created and assigned to individuals. During those meetings people will be able to ask for help if the scope of a problem was initially mis-understood.

#### What project management tool will be used?
- We will be using a Trello board as a project management tool.

# Git Process

- Plan out what your team’s Git workflow looks like for coding tasks.

- Describe at least:
#### What components of your project will live on GitHub?
- Front end (client to display card information) and back end (server getting api requests and sending the information back to the client)

#### How will you share the repository with your teammates?
- We will have a github team to share the repository.

#### What is your Git flow?
- We will make a new branch for each feature we add and push that up to GitHub.

#### Will you be using a PR review workflow? If so, consider:



#### How many people must review a PR?
- One person must review pushes to the development branch, more must approve when merging the development branch to the main. 




#### Who merges PRs?
- Whoever is around to review them. If someone has a branch to merge to development, they can message in the Slack for someone to go approve and merge it. 



#### How often will you merge?
- We will have an 8pm merge party


#### How will you communicate that it’s time to merge?
- Because it will be 8PM.
